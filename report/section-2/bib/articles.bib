    abstract="Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely known as an efficient
        supervised learning model for classification problems. However, the
        success of an SVM classifier depends on the perfect choice of its
        parameters as well as the structure of the data. Thus, the aim of this
        research is to simultaneously optimize the parameters and feature
        weighting in order to increase the strength of SVMs. We propose a novel
        hybrid model, the combination of genetic algorithms (GAs) and SVMs, for
        feature weighting and parameter optimization to solve classification
        problems efficiently. We call it as the GA-SVM model. Our GA is designed
        with a special direction-based crossover operator. Experiments were
        conducted on several real-world datasets using the proposed model and
        Grid Search, a traditional method of searching optimal parameters. The
        results show that the GA-SVM model achieves significant improvement in
        the performance of classification on all the datasets in comparison with
        Grid Search. In terms of accuracy, out method is competitive with some
        state-of-the-art techniques for feature selection and feature
        weighting.",
