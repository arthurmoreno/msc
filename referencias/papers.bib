abstract = {While modern off-the-shelf OCR engines show particularly high accuracy on scanned text, text detection and recognition in natural images still remains a challenging problem. Here, we demonstrate that OCR engines can still perform well on this harder task as long as appropriate image binarization is applied to input photographs. For such binarization, we systematically evaluate the performance of 12 binarization methods as well as of a new binarization algorithm that we propose here. Our evaluation includes different metrics and uses established natural image text recognition benchmarks (ICDAR 2003 and ICDAR 2011). Our main finding is thus the fact that image binarization methods combined with additional filtering of generated connected components and off-the-shelf OCR engines can achieve state-of-the-art performance for end-to-end text understanding in natural images.},
